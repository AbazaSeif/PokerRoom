Two algorithms:
  - Algorithm 1
    - Takes in 7 cards as a parameter
    - Determines the best hand given in the inputted 7 cards

  - Algorithm 2
    - Takes two hands as input and determines which is highest

Algorithm 1:  // If any step other than step 1 fails, the algorithm can break out and return the previous step
  1. Find single highest card
  2. Look for a single pair
  3. Look for a 2-pair
  4. Look for a 3 of a kind
  5. Look for a straight
  6. Look for a flush
  7. Look for a full house
  8. Look for a 4 of a kind
  9. Look for a straight flush
  10. Look for a royal flush

Algorithm 2:
  1. If the hands are of different categories, return the hand of of the higher category
  2. If the hands are of the same category, return the stronger hand:
        Which hand is stronger? Look here: https://www.briggsoft.com/docs/pmavens/PMHoldem.htm
