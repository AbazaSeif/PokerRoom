Sprint Planning Meeting

As a user of this software, I want to be able to...
  
  -Create an account so that I can begin playing
  -View the games in progress in a lobby so that I can join the games I want to
  -Create a room so that my friends can join the game I am creating
  -Add the blinds, so I am not "playing with pennies" -Joey's idea  
  -Reset my pasword if I forget mine
  -Have an options UI so I can manipulate the music, SFX, etc.
  -Create a room with a password/population cap so that I can make sure that only a certain number of my friends can enter into my game
  -See who's online so I can request users as friends and invite them to games whenever I like
  -Easily bet, call, fold, etc. on the game interface to make learning how to play the game easier
  -(using in-game currency or chips)when I am 'bankrupt', I can earn more credits somehow so I can resume playing
  -have a sort of system that gives me incentive to log in/be an active user so that I can redeem credits
